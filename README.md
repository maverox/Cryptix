# Cryptix

Cryptix is a simple encryption and decryption tool that uses the Caesar cipher to encrypt and decrypt text. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.

Although the Caesar cipher is a very weak form of encryption, it can be useful for learning about building cpp applications.
